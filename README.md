## Description
Partitioning images into discrete object components remains a significant challenge in computer vision, where noise and subtle differences among light and color give rise to blurred boundaries. Furthermore, existing models are trained on commonplace objects within a contemporary setting, limiting extensions to more specific topics such as types of jewelry or early modern artwork. Thereby, this project aims to fine tune models to draw pixel-level boundaries for each object portrayed in various types of input images by analyzing factors such as dominant colors, textures, and patterns. The results of this work can be applied to support image editing software and increase the efficiency of conducting inventory.
